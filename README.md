# Employee Attendance & Leave Tracking Dashboard

1. Project Overview
- This project builds a **Business Intelligence dashboard** in Power BI to track employee attendance and leave patterns.  
- The goal is to move beyond manual logs and provide real-time insights into workforce reliability and productivity.

2. Data Preparation
- Raw attendance logs across 3 months, aggregated into 253 employee-month records.
- Transformed categorical codes (P, WFH, LWP) using an Attendance Key.
- Performed ETL to derive clean monthly summary metrics.
- Designed a star schema for efficient dimensional modeling in Power BI.

3. Key Results
- Coverage: 253 employee-month records across Apr–Jun.
- Lost Productivity: **93.5 days** due to Leave Without Pay (LWP).
- LWP Rate: **2.27%** of total available workdays.
- Top Leave Driver: LWP identified as the most critical form of unplanned absence.

4. Insights & Recommendations
- **Staffing Opportunity:** High WFH usage validates remote work policy but suggests optimizing office space.  
- **Reliability Baseline:** 2.27% LWP rate serves as a benchmark for HR performance improvement.  
- **Strategic Advice:** Focus HR attention on reducing LWP and leverage the dashboard for smarter staff scheduling.
